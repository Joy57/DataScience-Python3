# DataScience-Python3

I decided to create this repository which will contain everything that relates to Data Science and Machine learning. As things grow and I learn more techniques as my knowledge grows this repository will also grow.

I'm planning to cover as many stuff I can find online related to machine learning and data mining techniques including:

1. Deep Learning / Neural Networks (MLP's, CNN's, RNN's)
2. Regression analysis
3. K-Means Clustering
4. Principal Component Analysis
5. Train/Test and cross validation
6. Bayesian Methods
7. Decision Trees and Random Forests
8. Multivariate Regression
9. Multi-Level Models
10. Support Vector Machines
